# Chatback

Chatback is a peer-to-peer support tool designed to help you through troubling situations.
The tool encourages you to practice introspective and empathetic techniques through anonymity and prompts given by a conversation agent.
This tool is being developed at the University of Washington. This is an early prototype and your feedback is welcome. Contact Katie Oâ€™Leary, PhD, kathlo@uw.edu.
